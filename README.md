# openHAB-Helper-Libraries-MQTT-Event-Bus
A MQTT Event Bus for openHAB 2.x and 3.x using the Helper Libraries for openHAB Scripted Automation. Tested with openHAB 2.x and openHAB 3.x. This should work equivalent like the [Event bus binding](https://v2.openhab.org/addons/bindings/mqtt1/#event-bus-binding-configuration) from the old [MQTT 1.x binding](https://v2.openhab.org/addons/bindings/mqtt1/).

Description:
Publish/receive all states/commmands directly on the openHAB eventbus.

Usage:
Perfect for integrating multiple openHAB instances or broadcasting all events.
